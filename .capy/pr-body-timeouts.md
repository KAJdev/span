Summary
- Add explicit timeouts around NATS client connect, WebSocket connect, and WebSocket receive operations in e2e/integration tests.
- Prevents tests from hanging indefinitely when NATS is not reachable or the WS server is not ready, surfacing failures promptly instead.
- Scope limited to test code only; no production behavior changes.

Details
- tests/nats_integration.rs: wrap async_nats::connect, WS connect, and ws_stream.next() in tokio::time::timeout with sensible limits.
- tests/e2e.rs: same adjustments for the end-to-end WS log streaming test.

Impact
- Eliminates intermittent CI timeouts/hangs observed in NATS e2e tests.
- If the environment cannot bring up NATS or establish WS, tests now fail fast with clear timeout errors.

Type of change
- fix: test robustness (timeouts)

Why
- The e2e tests could block the job when the NATS container didn’t become reachable or message delivery stalled. Timeouts make these failures visible and actionable instead of hanging.

Testing
- Built the test binaries locally and verified unit tests pass. Integration tests now have bounded wait times and will error out rather than hang when dependencies are unavailable.
